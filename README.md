# PrusaSlicerConfig
Settings Ver 2.3

Helping MakerGear Community , These are My Profile Settings please change the Start G Code as you would like as it is custom for my linkings.
Note : Remember to change the Start-G code As I made some changes to my hardware and Added Auto Leveling via Sensor . Take off that part
Mainly Copy , Paste your own Start , End G code to this profile.

This is My own version of the frimeware , Its Great if you want to add Auto Leveling. 


If you do not use the same custom frimeware that i am using and you did not tweak the settings of the acceleration and speed , jerk ... Please enable that in Prusa 
i made it (Ignore) as my frimeware settings are perfect but i have tweaked the values in the profile for you , So just enable it. 

In The Start G code i use M22 70 
This means that the feedrate is 70% , And everything will slow travel and print speed x,y,z,E Axis . I really Suggest you add this to your own Start Code At least 90% or 80% , I use 70% speed As i am doing mechanical Prints , For parts with no mechanics and no support ( Dont care much about quality go with any value Above 70 to 90)

Good Luck
