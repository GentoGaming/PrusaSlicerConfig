# PrusaSlicerConfig
Settings Ver 2.3

Helping MakerGear Community , These are My Profile Settings please change the Start G Code as you would like as it is custom for my linkings.
Note : Remember to change the Start-G code As I made some changes to my hardware and Added Auto Leveling via Sensor . Take off that part
Mainly Copy , Paste your own Start , End G code to this printer profile.

This is My own version of the frimeware , Its Great if you want to add Auto Leveling. 


If you do not use the same custom frimeware that i am using and you did not tweak the settings of the acceleration and speed , jerk ... Please enable that in Prusa 
i made it (Ignore) as my frimeware settings are perfect but i have tweaked the values in the profile for you , So just enable it. 
Good Luck
